.NET-Personal-Web-Site
======================

This is version one of my personal web site. I choose .net over something like wordpress as I really wanted a place for 
some experimentation with some more advanced .net methods. I choose .net mvc, entity framework code first and I utilized 
a respository pattern. Of course this is over kill for a fairly simple site but it was lots of fun learning new skills.
This was also my starting point with Angluar.js.
